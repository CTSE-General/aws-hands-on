# 👀 About Project
I know, there're tons of awesome developers in the world. But when I had started working as AWS field, there're less people who can guide me, how I could start with AWS Project properly with proper designs.

This repository will handle from single lambda function to complex but interesting combined architecture and usecases. 

If you are a beginner and you know what AWS Lambda function is. But you don't know exactly **how to test your lambda function locally**, or even didn't know that it's possible, then you are in right place. 🔥🔥🔥

I hope, this project will be your guideline into AWS Serverless Project and let you rethink about serverless. 🚀
